At the heart of this event, we have a unique and engaging format:

1. Engineers will submit a self-introduction page (bio) showcasing their deep
   technical insights, concepts, code, and so on.
1. Contributors who submit engaging and insightful activities and knowledge
   will have the opportunity to present as speakers.
1. Attendees will have the chance to share their technical knowledge in shorter
   "speed-dating" type sessions, fostering dynamic and rapid exchanges of ideas.
1. Ample opportunities for networking, collaboration, and discussions will be
   provided throughout the day.

Key requirements for the presentations include:

1. A strong focus on technical depth and innovation
