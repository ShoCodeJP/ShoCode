## Introduction

I'm a software engineer at Microsoft, working within our Industry Solutions
Engineering organization. I love the challenges and rewards that come with
software engineering, and I'm passionate about harnessing the power of software
to unlock new possibilities and drive meaningful change across different industries.

I am committed to continuous growth, staying up-to-date with the latest
technologies, and exploring new problem-solving approaches. I believe in
bringing together developer communities to create an environment where we
can learn, grow, and achieve more collectively.

Some of my ongoing interests include OpenTelemetry, an observability framework
for cloud-native software, and Dapr, a portable, event-driven runtime for
building distributed applications across cloud and edge. I'm also writing a
newsletter on
[Observability: A Platform Engineer's Perspective](https://www.linkedin.com/newsletters/7056157670537375744/).

## Technical Proposal

My technical proposal revolves around observability and platform engineering.
My [OpenTelemetryPlayground](https://github.com/drewby/OpenTelemetryPlayground)
repo on GitHub is an example of the work I've been doing in this space.
It's a project designed to explore the OpenTelemetry Specification and SDKs,
with working code using multiple languages OpenTelemetry libraries. It's a
work in progress, but will continue to evolve.

I'd to share about Observability and OpenTelemetry at ShoCode. Through code
examples and an active discussion, we can all learn more in this important space.

## Code Examples

You can find examples of my work on my GitHub repositories:

1. [OpenTelemetryPlayground](https://github.com/drewby/OpenTelemetryPlayground)
1. [otelcollector-example](https://github.com/drewby/otelcollector-example)

## Event Registration Preference

Please indicate your preference for attending the event:

- [X] Participate as a session speaker
- [ ] Participate in the "speed-dating" rounds
- [ ] As a participant, just publish my self-introduction page on this event repository

By selecting one of the options above, you indicate your availability and
interest in actively participating in the event beyond submitting your
self-introduction page.

Looking forward to connecting with the engineering community at the Shonan Code
Summit (ShoCode) and sharing our knowledge!
